> Yeoman generator for AngularJS - lets you quickly set up a project with sensible defaults and best practices.

There are many starting points for building a new Angular single page app, in addition to this one. You can find
other options in this list at 
[Yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io/generators).

[Roadmap for upcoming plans/features/fixes](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/issues/553)

## Usage

For step-by-step instructions on using Yeoman and this generator to build a TODO AngularJS application from scratch see [this tutorial.](http://yeoman.io/codelab/)

Install `yo`, `grunt-cli`, `bower`, `generator-angular` and `generator-karma`:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular
```

If you are planning on using Sass, you will need to first install Ruby and Compass:
- Install Ruby by downloading from [here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) or use Homebrew
- Install the compass gem:
```
gem install compass
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo angular`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo angular [app-name]
```

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview


## Generators

Available generators:

* [angular](#app) (aka [angular:app](#app))
* [angular:controller](#controller)
* [angular:directive](#directive)
* [angular:filter](#filter)
* [angular:route](#route)
* [angular:service](#service)
* [angular:provider](#service)
* [angular:factory](#service)
* [angular:value](#service)
* [angular:constant](#service)
* [angular:decorator](#decorator)
* [angular:view](#view)

### App
Sets up a new AngularJS app, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started. The app generator also optionally installs Bootstrap and additional AngularJS modules, such as angular-resource (installed by default).

Example:
```bash
yo angular
```

### Route
Generates a controller and view, and configures a route in `app/scripts/app.js` connecting them.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myroute
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/myroute.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyrouteCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```

Produces `app/views/myroute.html`:
```html
<p>This is the myroute view</p>
```

**Explicitly provide route URI**

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myRoute --uri=my/route
```

Produces controller and view as above and adds a route to `app/scripts/app.js`
with URI `my/route`

### Controller
Generates a controller in `app/scripts/controllers`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```
### Directive
Generates a directive in `app/scripts/directives`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:directive myDirective
```

Produces `app/scripts/directives/myDirective.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').directive('myDirective', function () {
  return {
    template: '<div></div>',
    restrict: 'E',
    link: function postLink(scope, element, attrs) {
      element.text('this is the myDirective directive');
    }
  };
});
```

### Filter
Generates a filter in `app/scripts/filters`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:filter myFilter
```

Produces `app/scripts/filters/myFilter.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').filter('myFilter', function () {
  return function (input) {
    return 'myFilter filter:' + input;
  };
});
```

### View
Generates an HTML view file in `app/views`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:view user
```

Produces `app/views/user.html`:
```html
<p>This is the user view</p>
```

### Service
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:service myService
```

Produces `app/scripts/services/myService.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').service('myService', function () {
  // ...
});
```

You can also do `yo angular:factory`, `yo angular:provider`, `yo angular:value`, and `yo angular:constant` for other types of services.

### Decorator
Generates an AngularJS service decorator.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:decorator serviceName
```

Produces `app/scripts/decorators/serviceNameDecorator.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').config(function ($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('serviceName', function ($delegate) {
      // ...
      return $delegate;
    });
  });
```

## Options
In general, these options can be applied to any generator, though they only affect generators that produce scripts.

### CoffeeScript and TypeScript
For generators that output scripts, the `--coffee` option will output CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript, and `--typescript` will output TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

For example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user --coffee
```

Produces `app/scripts/controller/user.coffee`:
```coffeescript
angular.module('myMod')
  .controller 'UserCtrl', ($scope) ->
```

For example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user --typescript
```

Produces `app/scripts/controller/user.ts`:
```typescript
/// <reference path="../app.ts" />

'use strict';

module demoApp {
    export interface IUserScope extends ng.IScope {
        awesomeThings: any[];
    }
    
    export class UserCtrl {

        constructor (private $scope:IUserScope) {
	        $scope.awesomeThings = [
              'HTML5 Boilerplate',
              'AngularJS',
              'Karma'
            ];
        }
    }
}

angular.module('demoApp')
  .controller('UserCtrl', demoApp.UserCtrl);
```

### Minification Safe

**tl;dr**: You don't need to write annotated code as the build step will
handle it for you.

By default, generators produce unannotated code. Without annotations, AngularJS's DI system will break when minified. Typically, these annotations that make minification safe are added automatically at build-time, after application files are concatenated, but before they are minified. The annotations are important because minified code will rename variables, making it impossible for AngularJS to infer module names based solely on function parameters.

The recommended build process uses `ng-annotate`, a tool that automatically adds these annotations. However, if you'd rather not use it, you have to add these annotations manually yourself. Why would you do that though? If you find a bug
in the annotated code, please file an issue at [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate/issues).


### Add to Index
By default, new scripts are added to the index.html file. However, this may not always be suitable. Some use cases:

* Manually added to the file
* Auto-added by a 3rd party plugin
* Using this generator as a subgenerator

To skip adding them to the index, pass in the skip-add argument:
```bash
yo angular:service serviceName --skip-add
```

## Bower Components

The following packages are always installed by the [app](#app) generator:

* angular
* angular-mocks


The following additional modules are available as components on bower, and installable via `bower install`:

* angular-animate
* angular-aria
* angular-cookies
* angular-messages
* angular-resource
* angular-sanitize

All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions of AngularJS are released.

`json3` and `es5-shim` have been removed as Angular 1.3 has dropped IE8 support and that is the last version that needed these shims. If you still require these, you can include them with: `bower install --save json3 es5-shim`. `wiredep` should add them to your index.html file but if not you can manually add them.

## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

### Output
You can change the `app` directory by adding an `appPath` property to `bower.json`. For instance, if you wanted to easily integrate with Express.js, you could add the following:

```json
{
  "name": "yo-test",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  ...
  "appPath": "public"
}

```
This will cause Yeoman-generated client-side files to be placed in `public`.

Note that you can also achieve the same results by adding an `--appPath` option when starting generator:
```bash
yo angular [app-name] --appPath=public
```

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

# _Material_Design= 

### What is the UX?

Below is a snapshot of the App with the Users' *master-detail* view. Also shown is the user
experience that will be displayed for smaller device sizes. The responsive layout changes to hide
the user list, reveal the **menu** button. In the User Details view, you may also click the
**share** button  to show the Contact &lt;User&gt; bottom sheet view.

<br/>

![material-starter-ux2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/210413/6448551/70864488-c0e0-11e4-8767-c4e1e4c2f343.png)

![Wireframe](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/210413/6444676/c247c8f8-c0c4-11e4-8206-208f55cbceee.png)

<br/>

This app demonstrates how:

*  Angular Material `layout` and `flex` options can easily configure HTML containers
*  Angular Material components `<md-toolbar>`, `<md-sidenav>`, `<md-icon>` can be quickly used
*  Custom controllers can use and show `<md-bottomsheet>` with HTML templates
*  Custom controller can easily, programmatically open & close the SideNav component.
*  Responsive breakpoints and `$mdMedia` are used
*  Theming can be altered/configured using `$mdThemingProvider`
*  ARIA features are supported by Angular Material and warnings can be used to improve accessibility.

> The application architecture **completely** seperates the front end app from the server side app


#### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and AngularJS framework code.  The tools
help us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We also get the AngularJS and Angular Material library code via `npm`

```
npm install
```

You should find that you have one new folder in your project:

 - `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need


## Directory Layout

```
app/                    --> all of the source files for the application
  assets/app.css        --> default stylesheet
  src/                  --> all app specific modules
     users/             --> package for user features
  index.html            --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
```


## Serving the Application Files

While AngularJS is client-side-only technology and it is possible to create AngularJS web apps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local web
server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via the `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.

### Running the App during Development

The angular-material project comes pre-configured with a local development web server. It is a
node.js tool called [live-server][live-server].

You can run the following command to start the server:

```
 node ./node_modules/live-server/live-server.js . --open=app
```

This should open your browser to [http://localhost:8080/app/](http://localhost:8080/app/) so you
can view the Material-Start app.

You can install also live-server globally to make life easier and for use with other applications:

```
npm install -g live-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
cd my-project
live-server .
```

Finally, you can choose to configure your a different webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.

## Updating Angular

Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-seed into your own fork of the
project. Now that the AngularJS framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers
(npm) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

## AngularFire [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/angularfire.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/angularfire) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/firebase/angularfire/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/firebase/angularfire?branch=master) [![Version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/firebase%2Fangularfire.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/gh/firebase%2Fangularfire)


AngularFire is the officially supported [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) binding for
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Firebase is a backend service that provides data storage,
file storage, authentication, and static website hosting for your Angular app.

AngularFire is a complement to the core Firebase client. It provides you with several Angular
services:
  * `$firebaseObject` - synchronized objects
  * `$firebaseArray` - synchronized collections
  * `$firebaseStorage` - store and retrieve user-generated content like images, audio, and video
  * `$firebaseAuth` - authentication, user management, routing

Join our [Firebase Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firebase-talk)
to ask questions, provide feedback, and share apps you've built with AngularFire.
